# lifesucksproject
Life Sucks Project (LSP) is a project that I've created for help the absolute life. In my intention, this bot is open source and you can modify this source code, but at least give me a credit this bot is come from and edit by you. 

Functions:
1) .ping - to check ping (ms)
2) .mine - to mine LSC (Life Sucks Coin) to use absolutely nothing
3) .date - check the date of today.
4) .tr [language that want to translate] ["sentence from source language"] - translate the absolute life.
5) .timer [min]" - timer the absolute life.
